    list1 and list2 have the same length. Return a list which contains the
    maximum element of each list for every index.

    Given a matrix encoded as a 2 dimensional python list, return a list
    containing all the values in the diagonal starting at the index 0, 0.

    mat = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

    | 3  4 |
    | 5  6 |

    Return a new dictionary which contains all the keys from d1 and d2 with
    their associated values. If a key is in both dictionaries, the value should
    be the sum of the two values.

    Given a file containing rows of text, create a dictionary whose keys
    are single characters. The value associated with each key is a list of all
    the line numbers which start with that letter. The first line should have
    line number 1.  Characters which never are the first letter of a line do
    not need to be included in your dictionary.

    Return a new pandas DataFrame which contains every city and the highest
    median rent from that city for 2011 and 2014.

    Note that city names are not unique and you need to use the state as well
    so that Portland, ME and Portland, OR are recognized as different.

    Your DataFrame should contain these columns:
        City, State, med_2011, med_2014
